5.4 In a certain city district the need for money to
buy drugs is stated as the: reason for 75% of all thefts.
Find the probability that among the next 5 theft cases
reported in this district,

(3/4)(x+5)

(a) exactly 2 resulted from the need for money to buy
drugs;

(3/4)(3/4)=(9/16)%

(b) at most 3 resulted from the need for money to buy
drugs.

at most (3/4)(3/4)(3/4)=(27/64)% chance at most.

This question is FULL of logical and ethical fallacies.

I would need at least 30 people to tell me truthfully why they did these things,

tolerance level measurements and continous neural enzyme concentration measurements,

that still wont tell me why the next thefts would happen, therefore, it is not a fact that 

75% of thefts happen because of this reason. this is a gross miscalculation, and people who think

in this way are a danger to themselves and to others.

5.8 According to a study published by a group of University of Massachusetts sociologists, about 60% 
of the Valium users in the state of Massachusetts first took Valium for psychological problems. Find 
the probability that among the next 8 users interviewed from this state,

(a) exactly 3 began taking Valium for psychological problems;

3*60/80=22.5%

(b) at least 5 began taking Valium for problems that were not psychological.

5*40/80=25%

5.9 In testing a certain kind of truck tire over a rugged terrain, it is found that 25% of these
trucks fail to complete the test run without a blowout. Of the next 15 trucks tested, find the 
probability that:

(a) from 3 to 6 have blowouts;

3(.25)/15=.25/5=5 and 10 % probability.

(b) fewer than 4 have blowouts:

4(.25)/15= 1/15 % or less.

(c) more than 5 have blowouts.

5(.25)/15=1.25/15 % or more.

5.11 The probability that a patient recovers from a delicate heart operation is 0.9. 
What is the probability that exactly 5 of the next 7 patients having this operation survive?

5(.9)/7=4.5/7 % chance, but chance is never an exact or exacting measure.

6.11 A lawyer commutes daily from his suburban home to his midtown office. The average time for a
one-way trip is 24 minutes, with a standard deviation of 3.8 minutes. Assume the distribution of 
trip times to be normally distributed.

(a) What is the probability that a trip will take at least 1/2 hour?

t[(24-30)/3.8]=t(-3/1.9)=t(-1.5789)= ~46%

(b) If the office opens at 9:00 A.M. and he leaves his house at 8:45 A.M. daily, what percentage of 
the time is he late for work?

t[(24-15)/3.8]=t[9/3.8]=t(2.3684)=~30.5%

(c) If he leaves the house at 8:35 A.M. and coffee is served at the office from 8:50 A.M. until 9:00
A.M., what is the probability that he misses coffee?

|t[(24-15)/3.8]-t[(24-25)/3.8]=~30.5%-t(.26)=~30% of the time.

(d) Find the length of time above which we find the slowest 15% of the trips.

t(.15)~5.15, 5.15+24=29.15 minutes

(e) Find the probability that 2 of the next 3 trips will take at least 1/2 hour.

2(46)/3=92/3=30.6...%

6.12 In the November 1990 issue of Chemical Engineering Progress, a study discussed the percent 
purity of oxygen from a certain supplier. Assume that the mean was 99.61 with a standard deviation 
of 0.08. Assume that the distribution of percent purity was approximately normal.

(a) What percentage of the purity values would you expect to be between 99.5 and 99.7?

t[(99.61-99.7)/.08]-t[(99.61-99.5)/.08]=t(90/8)-t(110/8)=t(11.25)-t(13.75)=.697-.694=.3%.

(b) What purity value would you expect to exceed exactly 5% of the population?

(8*.08)+99.61=100.25

6.13 The average life of a certain type of small motor is 10 years with a standard deviation of 2 
years. The manufacturer replaces free all motors that fail while under guarantee. If he is willing 
to replace only 3% of the motors that fail, how long a guarantee should he offer? Assume that the 
lifetime of a motor follows a normal distribution.

t[(10-p)/2]=3. p(3)=6.01. (6.01*2)+10=22.02 years (20 m.b. guarantee).

8.22 The heights of 1000 students are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 174.5 cm
and a standard deviation of 6.9 cm. Suppose 200 random samples of size 25 are drawn from this group
and the means recorded to ~.1cm. Determine

(a) the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of X ¯;

with a mean μ = 3.2 minutes and a standard deviation σ = 1.6 minutes. If a random sample of 64 
customers is observed, find the probability that their mean time at the teller’s window is

(a) at most 2.7 minutes;

z[(3.2-2.7)(8/1.6)]=z[2.5] or 99.38%, tellers may always spend more time than this.

9.92 A study was undertaken at Virginia Tech to determine if fire can be used as a viable management
tool to increase the amount of forage available to deer during the critical months in late winter 
and early spring. Calcium is a required element for plants and animals. The amount taken up and 
stored in plants is closely correlated to the amount present in the soil. It was hypothesized that a
fire may change the calcium levels present in the soil and thus affect the amount available to deer.
A large tract of land in the Fishburn Forest was selected for a prescribed burn. Soil samples were 
taken from 12 plots of equal area just prior to the burn and analyzed for calcium. Postburn calcium 
levels were analyzed from the same plots. These values, in kilograms per plot, are presented in the 
following table:
Plot Preburn Postburn

Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in calcium levels in the soil prior to 
and after the prescribed burn. Assume the distribution of differences in calcium levels as normal.

9.67 A clinical trial was conducted to determine if a certain type of inoculation has an effect on 
the incidence of a certain disease. A sample of 1000 rats was kept in a controlled environment for a
period of 1 year, and 500 of the rats were given the inoculation. In the group not inoculated, there
were 120 incidences of the disease, while 98 of the rats in the inoculated group contracted it. If 
p1 is the probability of incidence of the disease in uninoculated rats and p2 the probability of 
incidence in inoculated rats, compute a 90% confidence interval for p1 − p2.

Hi all, 
Please attempt the following questions for HW 7. It will be due on 4/11.
Page 356: 10.19, 10.20, 10.21, 10.22, 10.25, 10.26

19. In a research report, Richard H. Weindruch of the UCLA Medical School claims that mice with an
average life span of 32 months will live to be about 40 months old when 40% of the calories in their
diet are replaced by vitamins and protein. Is there any reason to believe that μ < 40 if 64 mice 
that are placed on this diet have an average life of 38 months with a standard deviation of 5.8 
months? Use a P-value in your conclusion.

(38-40)(8)/5.8=-16/5.8=2.758261; (38-32)(8)/5.8=48/5.8=8.25762
8.25762-2.758261=5.499241. 
z(2.75)=99.7%, 99.7>40, so is very likely.

20. A random sample of 64 bags of white cheddar popcorn weighed, on average, 5.23 ounces with a
standard deviation of 0.24 ounce. Test the hypothesis that μ = 5.5 ounces against the alternative
hypothesis, μ < 5.5 ounces, at the 0.05 level of significance.

(5.5-5.23)(8)/.24=9. z(-1.64)=.0505. t(60,.05)=1.671. 71>64, u<=5.5 ounces.

21. An electrical firm manufactures light bulbs that have a lifetime that is approximately normally
distributed with a mean of 800 hours and a standard deviation of 40 hours. Test the hypothesis that 
μ = 800 hours against the alternative, μ = 800 hours, if a random sample of 30 bulbs has an 
average life of 788 hours. Use a P-value in your answer.

(800-788)(5.47226)/40=1.641678. z(1.64)=.9495. u is very close to 800 hours.

22. In the American Heart Association journal Hypertension, researchers report that individuals who
practice Transcendental Meditation (TM) lower their blood pressure significantly. If a random sample
of 225 male TM practitioners meditate for 8.5 hours per week with a standard deviation of 2.25 
hours, does that suggest that, on average, men who use TM meditate more than 8 hours per week? 
Quote a P-value in your conclusion.

.5(15)/2.25=7.5/2.25=3.33. z(3.33)=.9996. Yes, this is very likely.

25. It is claimed that automobiles are driven on average more than 20,000 kilometers per year. To 
test this claim, 100 randomly selected automobile owners are asked to keep a record of the km they 
travel. Would you agree with this claim if the random sample showed an average of 23,500 km and a 
standard deviation of 3900 km? Use a P-value in your conclusion.

(3500)(10)/3900=350/39=8.974359. No, very unlikely.

26. According to a dietary study, high sodium intake may be related to ulcers, stomach cancer, and
migraine headaches. The human requirement for salt is only 220 mg per day, which is surpassed in
most single servings of ready-to-eat cereals. If a random sample of 20 similar servings of a certain
cereal has a mean sodium content of 244 milligrams and a sd of 24.5 milligrams, does this suggest at
 the 0.05 level of significance that the average sodium content for a single serving of such cereal 
 is greater than 220 milligrams? Assume the distribution of sodium contents to be normal.
 
 (244-220)(4.472136)/24.5=4.380868. t(20,.05)=1.725
 x=1.725(24.5/4.472136)+220 = 229.450182. Yes, this is greater.
 
Hi All,

Please attempt the following questions for HW 8. It will be due on 4/18.

Page 365: 10.55, 10.56, 10.60

55. A marketing expert for a pasta-making company believes that 40% of pasta lovers prefer lasagna.
If 9 out of 20 pasta lovers choose lasagna over other pastas, what can be concluded about the 
expert’s claim? Use a 0.05 level of significance.

(.45-.40)/rad((.45*.55)/20)=.4494
.45+1.725*sqrt((.45*.55)/20)=.6419
.45-1.725*sqrt((.45*.55)/20)=.2581
Using t(20,.05), we could say that there is a .45 chance of him being right 26 to 64 % of the time.

56. Suppose that, in the past, 40% of all adults favored capital punishment. Do we have reason to
believe that the proportion of adults favoring capital punishment has increased if, in a random 
sample of 15 adults, 8 favor capital punishment? Use a 0.05 level of significance.

(.53-.4)/sqrt((.53*.47)/15)=1.009
.53+1.753*sqrt((.53*.47)/15)=.7560
.53-1.753*sqrt((.53*.47)/15)=.3041
Since t>1, we may say that the proportion certainly increased.

60. At a certain college, it is estimated that at most 25% of the students ride bicycles to class. 
Does this seem to be a valid estimate if, in a random sample of 90 college students, 28 are found to ride bicycles to class? Use a 0.05 level of significance.

(.31-.25)/sqrt((.31*.69)/90)=1.23
Since t>1, the proportion must be much greater than the null value.

Page 369:  10.68, 10.69, 10.71

68. Past experience indicates that the time required for high school seniors to complete a standard
ized test is a normal random variable with a standard deviation of 6 minutes. Test the hypothesis 
that σ = 6 against the alternative that σ < 6 if a random sample of the test times of 20 high school seniors has a standard deviation s = 4.51. Use a 0.05 level of significance.

(n-1)(ss/aa)::X^2(s-1,%):  
19(20.3401/36)=10.735
::X(19,.05)=30.144
.: <6 min very unlikely. 

69. Aflotoxins produced by mold on peanut crops in Virginia must be monitored. A sample of 64 
batches of peanuts reveals levels of 24.17 ppm, on average, with a variance of 4.25 ppm. Test the hypothesis that σ2 = 4.2 ppm against the alternative that σ2 = 4.2 ppm. Use a P-value in your conclusion.

63(4.2/4.25)^2=61.526


71. A soft-drink dispensing machine is said to be out of control if the variance of the contents 
exceeds 1.15 deciliters. If a random sample of 25 drinks from this machine has a variance of 2.03 deciliters, does this indicate at the 0.05 level of significance that the machine is out of control? Assume that the contents are approximately normally distributed.

Yes, since 2.03>1.15.

10.31 A manufacturer claims that the average tensile strength of thread A exceeds the average 
tensile strength of thread B by at least 12 kilograms. To test this claim, 50 pieces of each type of thread were tested under similar conditions. Type A thread had an average tensile strength of 86.7 kilograms with a standard deviation of 6.28 kilograms, while type B thread had an average tensile strength of 77.8 kilograms with a standard deviation of 5.61 kilograms. Test the manufacturer’s claim using a 0.05 level of significance.

10.32 Amstat News (December 2004) lists median salaries for associate professors of statistics at research institutions and at liberal arts and other institutions in the United States. Assume that a sample of 200 associate professors from research institutions has an average salary of $70,750 per year with a standard deviation of $6000. Assume also that a sample of 200 associate professors from other types of institutions has an average salary of $65,200 with a standard deviation of $5000. Test the hypothesis that the mean salary for associate professors in research institutions is $2000
higher than for those in other institutions. Use a 0.01 level of significance.

10.33 A study was conducted to see if increasing the substrate concentration has an appreciable effect on the velocity of a chemical reaction. With a substrate concentration of 1.5 moles per liter, the reaction was run 15 times, with an average velocity of 7.5 micro moles per 30 minutes and a standard deviation of 1.5. With a substrate concentration of 2.0 moles per liter, 12 runs were made, yielding an average velocity of 8.8 micromoles per 30 minutes and a sample standard deviation of 1.2. Is there any reason to believe that this increase in substrate concentration causes an increase in the mean velocity of the reaction of more than 0.5 micromole per 30 minutes? Use a 0.01 level of significance and assume the populations to be approximately normally distributed with equal variances.

10.34 A study was made to determine if the subject matter in a physics course is better understood when a lab constitutes part of the course. Students were randomly selected to participate in either a 3-semesterhour course without labs or a 4-semester-hour course with labs. In the section with labs, 11 students made an average grade of 85 with a standard deviation of 4.7, and in the section without labs, 17 students made an average grade of 79 with a standard deviation of 6.1.
Would you say that the laboratory course increases the average grade by as much as 8 points? Use a P-value in your conclusion and assume the populations to be approximately normally distributed with equal variances.

10.35 To find out whether a new serum will arrest leukemia, 9 mice, all with an advanced stage of 
the disease, are selected. Five mice receive the treatment and 4 do not. Survival times, in years, from the time the experiment commenced are as follows:
Treatment 2.1 5.3 1.4 4.6 0.9
No Treatment 1.9 0.5 2.8 3.1
At the 0.05 level of significance, can the serum be said to be effective? Assume the two populations to be normally distributed with equal variances.

10.44 In a study conducted by the Department of Human Nutrition and Foods at Virginia Tech, 
the following data were recorded on sorbic acid residuals, in parts per million, in ham immediately after dipping in a sorbate solution and after 60 days of storage:
Sorbic Acid Residuals in Ham
Slice Before Storage After Storage
1 224 116
2 270  96
3 400 239
4 444 329
5 500 437
6 660 597
7 1400689
8 680 576
Assuming the populations to be normally distributed, is there sufficient evidence, at the 0.05 level of significance, to say that the length of storage influences sorbic acid residual concentrations?

10.45 A taxi company manager is trying to decide whether the use of radial tires instead of regular
belted tires improves fuel economy. Twelve cars were equipped with radial tires and driven over a prescribed test course. Without changing drivers, the same cars were then equipped with regular belted tires and driven once again over the test course. The gasoline consump tion, in kilometers per liter, was recorded as follows:
Kilometers per Liter
Car Radial Tires Belted Tires
1 4.2 4.1
2 4.7 4.9
3 6.6 6.2
4 7.0 6.9
5 6.7 6.8
6 4.5 4.4
7 5.7 5.7
8 6.0 5.8
9 7.4 6.9
10 4.9 4.7
11 6.1 6.0
12 5.2 4.9
Can we conclude that cars equipped with radial tires give better fuel economy than those equipped 
with belted tires? Assume the populations to be normally distributed. Use a P-value in your conclusion.

Hi all,

For the extra credit assignment please attempt the following questions. It will be due on 5/10.

Page 382:  10.79, 10.80, 10.81, 10.86 

10.79 A machine is supposed to mix peanuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans in the ratio 5:2:2:1. A 
can containing 500 of these mixed nuts was found to have 269 peanuts, 112 hazelnuts, 74 cashews, and
45 pecans. At the 0.05 level of significance, test the hypothesis that the machine is mixing the 
nuts in the ratio 5:2:2:1.

 19, 12, 26, 5;62
 Machine is off by an average of 15.5 nuts.
cx=7.815: tx= ((19-15.5)^2 + (15.5-12)^2 + (26-15.5)^2 + (15.5-5)^2)/15.5
= (3.5^2 + 3.5^2 + 10.5^2 + 10.5^2)/15.5 = (24.5+220.5)/15.5 = 245/15.5=15.806
This is obviously not a normal distribution.
 
 10.80 The grades in a statistics course for a particular semester were as follows:
 Test the hypothesis, at the 0.05 level of significance, that the distribution of grades is uniform.
 Grade A, B, C, D, F
 f     14,18,32,20,16;100
 d     20,20,20,20,20;100
 e      6, 2,12, 0, 4;24;5.08
 cx=(4,.05)=9.488
 tx=(.8464+9.4864+50.1264+25.8064+1.1664)/5.08=17.21
 This data set is not normally distributed.

cx=(5,.01)=15.086
tx=(4+4+4+16+1+9)/4=38/4=9.5.
We can say that this is a balanced die since tx<cx.

10.86 In an experiment to study the dependence of hypertension on smoking habits, the following data
